contact us to find out more about what's happened, or you have any
concerns, just <a href="mailto:victor_traian@yahoo.com">email us</a>
and we'll be happy to get right back to you.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, if you want to go back to the page that caused
the problem, you can do that <a href="<?=SITE_ROOT?>">by
clicking here.</a> If the same problem occurs, though, you may
want to come back a bit later. We bet we'll have things figured
out by then. Thanks again... we'll see you soon. And again, we're
really sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
